signifigance weight

default voting

inverse user frequence

- average user and item based for hybrid.

Include probe data for training

Breese et al. (1998)

Use a threshold for the neighbourhood size that is dynamic

Implement a Trust based system on top of Resnick

Use amplifications of neighbours with higher similarity

- Also use Item based collaborative filtering hybrid

Cross-verification folding

Use content based recommendations hybrid e.g. genre Use the Genre tags to help with predictions?

SVD

Matrix factorization
Consider Singular Value Decomposition 
or
 Restricted Boltzmann Machine

Look for patterns of users that rate mostly widely popular films mostly. Maybe there is a pattern of users segmentation that might improve the over rating

Considering ignoring very popular movies altogether as this won't really help if everyone up votes 5 stars for Star Wars for example.

--

Ignore users who have only rated less than 5 books which are not "blockbusters" will lower coverage but maybe will be enough.
Alternatively use some form of item based averages to fill in gaps in user ratings.. possibly weighed by genre of the small set

Or 

If the number of ratings are low by a specific user then use some weighting algorihtm to give more power the item based filtering 
e.g. using the mean rating for a film to heavily influence the minimal data you have to work with.

Look at outputting RMSE based on how many ratings the user has made. e.g 

# of ratings	# of users in set		RMSE for this set
<= 1 				2334					1.42323
<= 2							
<= 7
<= 20
<= 54	
<= 148
<= 403
<= 1096
<= 2980
..

The increments on an 1-5 scale should not be viewed as equal, those at the edges are bigger.

Likert scales give ordinal data. That it (sic), the data is ranked "strongly agree" is usually better than "agree." However,
it's not interval data. You can't say the distances between "strongly agree" and "agree" would be the same as "neutral" and
"disagree," for example. People tend to think there is a bigger difference between items at the extremes of the scale than 
in the middle (there is some evidence cited in Kaptein's paper that this is the case). For ordinal data, one should use 
non-parametric statistical tests which do not assume a normal distribution of the data. Furthermore, because of this it makes 
no sense to report means of likert scale data--you should report the mode.

Consider re-normaise ratings onto a non-linear interval scale

Can probability help in determining a prediction rating?
