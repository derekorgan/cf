v0.08
----------------------------------------



v0.07 - Updated K neighbours size for Item based filtering
----------------------------------------

The optimal neighbours for items is going to be different than for users.

10 - 0.9967420413981437
20 - 0.9893376268480041
22 - 0.9890844621387769
30 - 0.9906882336731407
40 - 0.9916727257768321

Some testing reveals 22 as the optimal number for the current setup on the probe data.

RSME: 0.9890844621387769
Coverage: 100.0%

v0.06 - Item based filtering
----------------------------------------
Changed code to test item based filtering instead of User based.

Item base seems to return better results than User based on the probe data.

WEEK 2/3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.05 - Updated the Item Class to include other attributes such as year	
----------------------------------------
I've added year as an accessible attribute of item.

TODO: Add genre tags 



v0.04 - Added in Resnick Predictor Algorithm
----------------------------------------
Created a new predictor class using Resnick's algorigthm. 
By using a combination of Pearson's Simlarity and Resnick's predictor I found some improvement with the probe data.

Pearson + Resnick
RMSE: 1.0116696920563688
coverage: 99.79753359101785%

By using Cosine with Resnick I found it to have a better combinational effect on the probe data

Cosine + Resnick 
RMSE: 1.0037745315841637
coverage: 100.0%

WEEK 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.03 - Tested Pearson Similarity correlation - Feb 7. 2012
----------------------------------------

I changed the similarity algorithm to use Pearsons instead of Cosine which show an improvement with a very small coverage loss. 


RMSE: 1.100091240396238
coverage: 99.79753359101785%


v0.02 - Updated Fixed Neighbourhood size  - Feb 6, 2012
---------------------------------------

I tested changing the neighbourhood size to range between 1 and 100.  The following results were found


N size		RSME 
1 			1.4961451171826305
5			1.1831599539083058 
10 			1.134420381930053
20 			1.110594693291348
30			1.1073889468207587
40 			1.1058960051034536
50			1.1045085051581185  << best result
60			1.1053132181268333
70			1.1066042356564234
80			1.1069454038242852
90 			1.1071530413192758
100 		1.107469530198342

From the graph of information above we can see that a neighbourhood size of 50 gives the best results for our probe data with a fixed size. 

With bit more refinement I found 53 to be the optimal fix size for this set.

Result RSME: 1.1043132359396504 
coverage: 100%

v0.01 - Fixed Bugs - Feb 2nd, 2012
---------------------------------------

I found and fixed the two bugs. 

* Cosine Algorihtm was in correct
* Index in for loop for Mean Predictor referenced first item instead of incrementing.

Result RSME: 1.134420381930053
Coverage: 100%
