WEEK 4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.10 - Weighed item and user based predictions average 
----------------------------------------




v0.09 - Hybrid Item and User Based 
----------------------------------------
I decided to average my user based and item based scores to get a better approximation.

Code changes: 
In the Evaluator.java file I get predictions for user and item based and average them. 

RMSE: 0.9887045221561072
coverage: 100.0%

v0.08 - Testing Minimum neighbour size
----------------------------------------

I decided to experiment with a minimum neighbour size. In the current code it sets the minimum size to 0.  

For the User Based filtering I found the following results.

User Based Filtering
Cosine + Resnick  Max K = 53
k >         coverage         RSME
0			100%			 1.0037
4			99.96%		     1.0031
7 		    99.74%			 1.0036
10 			98.80%           1.0047
15			95.17%			 1.0061
20			89.09%			 1.0001
25			82.96%			 0.9980
30	        77.08%			 0.9989

There does seem to be a minor improvement but the coverage gets too low after a while.  
All users have a minimum of 4 neighbours as coverage is 100% up to this point. 

Item Based Filtering
Cosine + Resnick  Max K = 22
k >         coverage         RSME
0			100%			 0.9891		
7			99.98%			 0.9891
10			99.82%			 0.9892
15			95.98%			 0.9870	
20			84.76%			 0.9842		

All items have a minimum of 7 neighbours as coverage is 100% up to this point.

The main conclusion is setting a min size has a negligible effect on the RSME and I'm leaving it at 0.

v0.07 - Updated K neighbours size for Item based filtering
----------------------------------------

The optimal neighbours for items is going to be different than for users.

10 - 0.9967420413981437
20 - 0.9893376268480041
22 - 0.9890844621387769
30 - 0.9906882336731407
40 - 0.9916727257768321

Some testing reveals 22 as the optimal number for the current setup on the probe data.

RSME: 0.9890844621387769
Coverage: 100.0%

v0.06 - Item based filtering
----------------------------------------
Changed code to test item based filtering instead of User based.

Item base seems to return better results than User based on the probe data.

Cosine + Resnick
RMSE: 0.992956721533153
coverage: 100.0%


WEEK 2/3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.05 - Updated the Item Class to include other attributes such as year	
----------------------------------------
I've added year as an accessible attribute of item.

TODO: Add genre tags 



v0.04 - Added in Resnick Predictor Algorithm
----------------------------------------
Created a new predictor class using Resnick's algorigthm. 
By using a combination of Pearson's Simlarity and Resnick's predictor I found some improvement with the probe data.

Pearson + Resnick
RMSE: 1.0116696920563688
coverage: 99.79753359101785%

By using Cosine with Resnick I found it to have a better combinational effect on the probe data

Cosine + Resnick 
RMSE: 1.0037745315841637
coverage: 100.0%

WEEK 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.03 - Tested Pearson Similarity correlation - Feb 7. 2012
----------------------------------------

I changed the similarity algorithm to use Pearsons instead of Cosine which show an improvement with a very small coverage loss. 


RMSE: 1.100091240396238
coverage: 99.79753359101785%


v0.02 - Updated Fixed Neighbourhood size  - Feb 6, 2012
---------------------------------------

I tested changing the neighbourhood size to range between 1 and 100.  The following results were found


N size		RSME 
1 			1.4961451171826305
5			1.1831599539083058 
10 			1.134420381930053
20 			1.110594693291348
30			1.1073889468207587
40 			1.1058960051034536
50			1.1045085051581185  << best result
60			1.1053132181268333
70			1.1066042356564234
80			1.1069454038242852
90 			1.1071530413192758
100 		1.107469530198342

From the graph of information above we can see that a neighbourhood size of 50 gives the best results for our probe data with a fixed size. 

With bit more refinement I found 53 to be the optimal fix size for this set.

Result RSME: 1.1043132359396504 
coverage: 100%

v0.01 - Fixed Bugs - Feb 2nd, 2012
---------------------------------------

I found and fixed the two bugs. 

* Cosine Algorihtm was in correct
* Index in for loop for Mean Predictor referenced first item instead of incrementing.

Result RSME: 1.134420381930053
Coverage: 100%
